       #Method to make Cheesy Baked Jacket Potatoes#

~ Scrub and clean the potatoes well (placing them in a hot tub of water helps to get rid of the dirt and germs easily).

~ Brush the potatoes generously with olive oil and salt. Donâ€™t skimp on the oil if you want a crispy skin and don't skimp 
  with the salt either, if you want tasty potatoes.
  Bake in a hot oven at 200 degree celsius for about 45 minutes, until done.
  
~ Allow it to cool in a bowl, mix the cheese, herbs and a little salt if required.

~ With the help of a knife,slit open the potatoes in the centre,keeping the base of the potatoes intact and stuff them 
  with the prepared cheese mixture.

~ Grill the potatoes in a hot oven at 200C/400F until the cheese melts and is a little browned.
~ Serve hot with sauce,chutney or with any other semi-liquid paste.

* Every oven is different. Depending on your oven and the size of your potatoes, the cooking time can vary between 45 
  minutes to an hour.
